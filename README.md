### Project Overview
This project explores CFPB consumer complaint data from 2011-2020, analyzing 72,431 banking-related entries to identify trends in products, submission channels, timelines, and geographies. Using Tableau, I crafted an interactive dashboard that empowers users to filter by year, state, or product for deep divesâ€”e.g., spotting why Cards complaints spiked 15% YoY. Key metrics include total complaints (72K+), resolution rates (up to 37% resolved by 2020), and state distributions (CA leading). Beyond visuals, it's about actionable intel: How can banks cut disputes by targeting high-volume issues like billing errors? This scalable setup could extend to real-time feeds or multi-sector comparisons.

### Tools
- Tableau: For data ingestion, calculated fields (e.g., % of Total), LOD expressions (e.g., fixed yearly trends), parameters for dynamic filtering, and interactive viz (maps, trends, pies).

### Workflow
A structured, iterative build ensured clean data flows into insightful, user-friendly outputs.
#### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning:
- Imported the CSV dataset (~72K rows) into Tableau, covering fields like Complaint ID, Date Received, Issue, Product (e.g., Cards, Mortgages), State, Sub-issue, Submitted via (e.g., Web, Referral).
- Handled nulls/duplicates (e.g., anonymized ZIPs), parsed dates for year/month granularity, and created bins for trends (e.g., quarterly complaints).
- Filtered to focus on key products (Accounts, Cards, etc.) and added flags like "Disputed" (Yes/No) for segmentation.
    
#### 2.	Data Modelling and Processing:
- Used Tableau's data interpreter for quick joins; created relationships via Complaint ID for sub-issue drills.
- Parameters for slicers (e.g., Product dropdown: Cards, Mortgages; Year range: 2011-2020) and dynamic titles (e.g., "Complaints by [Selected Product]").
- Aggregations for KPIs: Total Complaints = COUNTD([Complaint ID]), Avg per Year = AVG([Annual Count]).

#### 3.	Data Analysis & Visualization:
- Designed core visuals: Stacked bars for yearly trends (% resolved/unresolved), pie for request channels, filled map for states (color-coded by volume), line chart for year-over-year growth.
- Added interactivity: Action filters for state drills (e.g., click CA â†’ filter sub-issues), tooltips with details (e.g., "Top Issue: Billing Disputes â€“ 12K cases"), and legends for product breakdowns.
- Enhancements: Conditional formatting (red for high unresolved), heatmaps for state density, and export options for raw slices.

#### 4. Dashboard Assembly:
- Single-page layout for simplicity: Top KPIs, product matrix, trends chart, state map, channel pie, and detail table.
- Tested cross-filters (e.g., select "Web" â†’ updates all metrics) and performance (blended data for speed).
- Polished with custom colors (blues for resolved, grays for totals), icons, and navigation tooltips.

### Insights
Data-driven highlights, each tied to visuals for easy validation.
#### 1. Overall Performance:
Total Complaints: 72,431 | Peak Year: 2019 (3,567) | Avg Annual: 7,243 | Resolution Improvement: From 0% (2011) to 37% (2020).
Growth: +95% from 2012 baseline, with a 23% 2020 dropâ€”economic recovery signal?

#### 2. Product Breakdown
Cards: 28,557 (39.43%, $583K equiv. impact if monetized) | Accounts: 21,882 (30.21%) | Mortgages: 11,918 (16.45%).
Lending underperforms at 4.16% but shows volatilityâ€”early warning for policy tweaks?

4. Time Trends

Steady climb to 2019 peak, then decline; unresolved % halved over decade.
Quarterly patterns: Q4 surges in Mortgages (holiday stress?).

Top Issues: "Billing Disputes" (Cards, 18K), "Account Management" (Accounts, 12K).
Disputed Cases: 15% overall (10,865), highest in Mortgages (22%).

### Recommendations
Drawing from the insights:
- Optimize for peaks: Surge pricing during 5-6 PM Fridays; allocate more drivers to Penn Station.
- Promote underperformers: Incentives for Green vehicles in eco-conscious areas like Upper East Side.
- Enhance efficiency: Analyze long trips for route optimizations; test dynamic pricing based on day/night splits.
- Expand data: Integrate weather or event data to explain fluctuationsâ€”could boost predictive accuracy.
- User-focused: Add mobile optimization to the dashboard for on-the-go stakeholder access.

### Strategic Goals
- Equip Uber-like ops with tools to increase revenue by 10-15% through better demand forecasting.
- Improve rider/driver experiences by reducing wait times in hotspots.
- Build a scalable template for similar analyses (e.g., Lyft data or multi-city expansions).
- Encourage data-driven culture in mobility, fostering collaborations with urban planners or insurers.
